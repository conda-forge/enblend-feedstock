  summary: Enblend combines images that overlap like this into a single large image with no seams.

  description: |
    Enblend blends away the seams in a panoramic image mosaic using a
    multi-resolution spline. Enfuse merges different exposures of the same
    scene to produce an image that looks much like a tone-mapped image.
